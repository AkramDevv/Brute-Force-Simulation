# Brute Force Simulation Project

This project demonstrates a brute force simulation using a custom API built with Flask. 
It is intended purely for educational and experimental purposes to learn about API requests, multithreading, and brute force attack prevention mechanisms.

**Note**: This project does not target any real-world service or platform.
